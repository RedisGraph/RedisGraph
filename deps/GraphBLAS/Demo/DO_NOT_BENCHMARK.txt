    These methods are simple ones, meant for illustration only.  They can be
    slow.  Use LAGraph for benchmarking and use in production.  Do not use any
    of these methods in user applications.  Eventually, this Demo folder will
    be removed, and its purpose will be achieved in LAGraph instead.
