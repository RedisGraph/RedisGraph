        Abstract: Wilkinson defined a sparse matrix as one with
        enough zeros that it pays to take advantage of them.  This informal yet
        practical definition captures the essence of the goal of direct methods
        for solving sparse matrix problems. They exploit the sparsity of a
        matrix to solve problems economically: much faster and using far less
        memory than if all the entries of a matrix were stored and took part in
        explicit computations. These methods form the backbone of a wide range
        of problems in computational science. A glimpse of the breadth of
        applications relying on sparse solvers can be seen in the origins of
        matrices in published matrix benchmark collections (Duff and Reid
        1979a, Duff, Grimes and Lewis 1989a, Davis and Hu 2011). The goal of
        this survey article is to impart a working knowledge of the underlying
        theory and practice of sparse direct methods for solving linear systems
        and least-squares problems, and to provide an overview of the
        algorithms, data structures, and software available to solve these
        problems, so that the reader can both understand the methods and know
        how best to use them.

        From the preface: Graphs are among the most important
        abstract data types in computer science, and the algorithms that
        operate on them are critical to modern life. Graphs have been shown to
        be powerful tools for modeling complex problems because of their
        simplicity and generality. Graph algorithms are one of the pillars of
        mathematics, informing research in such diverse areas as combinatorial
        optimization, complexity theory, and topology. Algorithms on graphs are
        applied in many ways in today's worldâ€”from Web rankings to metabolic
        networks, from finite element meshes to semantic graphs.
        The current exponential growth in graph data has forced a shift to
        parallel computing for executing graph algorithms. Implementing
        parallel graph algorithms and achieving good parallel performance have
        proven difficult. This book addresses these challenges by exploiting
        the well-known duality between a canonical representation of graphs as
        abstract collections of vertices and edges and a sparse adjacency
        matrix representation. This linear algebraic approach is widely
        accessible to scientists and engineers who may not be formally trained
        in computer science. The authors show how to leverage existing parallel
        matrix computation techniques and the large amount of software
        infrastructure that exists for these computations to implement
        efficient and scalable parallel graph algorithms. The benefits of this
        approach are reduced algorithmic complexity, ease of implementation,
        and improved performance.

abstract = {SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is a full implementation of the GraphBLAS standard, which defines a set of sparse matrix operations on an extended algebra of semirings using an almost unlimited variety of operators and types. When applied to sparse adjacency matrices, these algebraic operations are equivalent to computations on graphs. GraphBLAS provides a powerful and expressive framework for creating graph algorithms based on the elegant mathematics of sparse matrix operations on a semiring. An overview of the GraphBLAS specification is given, followed by a description of the key features and performance of its implementation in the SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS package.},
