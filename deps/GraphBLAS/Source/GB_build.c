// CALLED BY: GB_matvec_build and GB_reduce_to_vector
// CALLS:     GB_builder

// GB_matvec_build constructs a GrB_Matrix or GrB_Vector from the tuples
// provided by the user.  In that case, the tuples must be checked for
// duplicates.  They might be sorted on input, so this condition is checked and
// exploited if found.  GB_reduce_to_vector constructs a GrB_Vector froma
// GrB_Matrix, by discarding the vector index.  As a result, duplicates are
// likely to appear, and the input is likely to be unsorted.  But for
// GB_reduce_to_vector, the validity of the tuples need not be checked.  All of
// these conditions are checked in GB_builder.

// GB_build constructs a matrix C from a list of indices and values.  Any
// duplicate entries with identical indices are assembled using the binary dup
// operator provided on input.  All three types (x,y,z for z=dup(x,y)) must be
// identical.  The types of dup, S, and C must all be compatible.

// Duplicates are assembled using T(i,j) = dup (T (i,j), S (k)) into a
// temporary matrix T that has the same type as the dup operator.  The
// GraphBLAS spec requires dup to be associative so that entries can be
// assembled in any order.  There is no way to check this condition if dup is a
// user-defined operator.  It could be checked for built-in operators, but the
// GraphBLAS spec does not require this condition to cause an error so that is
// not done here.  If dup is not associative, the GraphBLAS spec states that
// the results are not defined.

// SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS provides a well-defined order of assembly, however.
// For a CSC format, entries in [I,J,S] are first sorted in increasing order of
// row and column index via a stable sort, with ties broken by the position of
// the tuple in the [I,J,S] list.  If duplicates appear, they are assembled in
// the order they appear in the [I,J,S] input.  That is, if the same indices i
// and j appear in positions k1, k2, k3, and k4 in [I,J,S], where k1 < k2 < k3
// < k4, then the following operations will occur in order:

//      T (i,j) = S (k1) ;

//      T (i,j) = dup (T (i,j), S (k2)) ;

//      T (i,j) = dup (T (i,j), S (k3)) ;

//      T (i,j) = dup (T (i,j), S (k4)) ;

// This is a well-defined order but the user should not depend upon it since
// the GraphBLAS spec does not require this ordering.  Results may differ in
// different implementations of GraphBLAS.

// However, with this well-defined order, the SECOND operator will result in
// the last tuple overwriting the earlier ones.  This is relied upon internally
// by GB_wait.

// After the matrix T is assembled, it is typecasted into the type of C, the
// final output matrix.  No typecasting is done during assembly of duplicates,
// since mixing the two can break associativity and lead to unpredictable
// results.  Note that this is not the case for GB_wait, which must typecast
// each tuple into its output matrix in the same order they are seen in
// the [I,J,S] pending tuples.

// On input, C must not be NULL.  C->type, C->vlen, C->vdim and C->is_csc must
// be valid on input and are unchanged on output.  C must not have any existing
// entries on input (GrB_*_nvals (C) must return zero, per the specification).
// However, all existing content in C is freed.

// The list of numerical values is given by the void * S array and a type code,
// scode.  The latter is defined by the actual C type of the S parameter in
// the user-callable functions.  However, for user-defined types, there is no
// way of knowing that the S array has the same type as dup or C, since in that
// case S is just a void * pointer.  Behavior is undefined if the user breaks
// this condition.

// C is returned as hypersparse or non-hypersparse, depending on the number of
// non-empty vectors of C.  If C has very few non-empty vectors, then it is
// returned as hypersparse.  Only if the number of non-empty vectors is
// Omega(n) is C returned as non-hypersparse, which implies nvals is Omega(n),
// where n = # of columns of C if CSC, or # of rows if CSR.  As a result, the
// time taken by this function is just O(nvals*log(nvals)), regardless of what
// format C is returned in.

// The input arrays I_input, J_input, and S_input are not modified.
// If nvals == 0, I_input, J_input, and S_input may be NULL.
