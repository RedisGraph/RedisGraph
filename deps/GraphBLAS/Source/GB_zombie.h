// GB_FLIP is a kind of "negation" about (-1) of a zero-based index.
// If i >= 0 then it is not flipped.
// If i < 0 then it has been flipped.
// Like negation, GB_FLIP is its own inverse: GB_FLIP (GB_FLIP (i)) == i.
// The "nil" value, -1, doesn't change when flipped: GB_FLIP (-1) = -1.
// GB_UNFLIP(i) is like taking an absolute value, undoing any GB_FLIP(i).

// An entry A(i,j) in a matrix can be marked as a "zombie".  A zombie is an
// entry that has been marked for deletion, but hasn't been deleted yet because
// it's more efficient to delete all zombies all at once, instead of one at a
// time.  Zombies are created by submatrix assignment, C(I,J)=A which copies
// not only new entries into C, but it also deletes entries already present in
// C.  If an entry appears in A but not C(I,J), it is a new entry; new entries
// placed in the pending tuple lists to be added later.  If an entry appear in
// C(I,J) but NOT in A, then it is marked for deletion by flipping its row
// index, marking it as a zombie.

// Zombies can be restored as regular entries by GrB_*assign.  If an assignment
// C(I,J)=A finds an entry in A that is a zombie in C, the zombie becomes a
// regular entry, taking on the value from A.  The row index is unflipped.

// Zombies are deleted and pending tuples are added into the matrix all at
// once, by GB_wait.
