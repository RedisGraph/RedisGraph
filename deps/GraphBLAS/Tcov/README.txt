GraphBLAS/Tcov: statement coverage tests

Requirements:  the mex command must use a C compiler supporting ANSI C11.
Microft Visual Studio does not support ANSI C11 so this test is not available
on Windows unless you use another compiler.

Since nearly all GraphBLAS tests are in MATLAB, I have taken the unusual step
of creating a statement coverage mechanism to use within a MATLAB mexFunction.
To compile GraphBLAS for statement coverage testing, and to run the tests, type
this in the MATLAB command window.

    grbcov

If you get a linking problem on linux, add this directory to your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so that the libgraphblas_tcov.so constructed by grbmake can be
found by the mexFunctions.

Statement coverage tests results will be saved in Tcov/log.txt.

The lines covered by the test are marked in each file in tmp_cover/.

To remove all compiled files, type this in the Unix/Linux shell:

    make distclean

Or, delete these files manually:

    *.o *.obj *.mex* cover_*.c errlog*.txt grbstat.mat tmp*/*

To also remove the log.txt file:

    make purge
