function C = single (G)
%SINGLE cast a GraphBLAS matrix to built-in full single matrix.
% C = single (G) typecasts the GrB matrix G to a built-in full single
% matrix.  The result C is full since sparse single matrices are not
% built-in.  C is real if G is real, and complex if G is complex.
%
% To typecast the matrix G to a GraphBLAS sparse single matrix instead,
% use C = GrB (G, 'single').  To typecast to a sparse single complex
% matrix, use G = GrB (G, 'single complex').
