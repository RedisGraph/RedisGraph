function C = cat (dim, varargin)
%CAT Concatenate arrays.
% C = cat (dim, A, B) concatenates the two matrices A and B along the
% dimension dim, which must be 1 or 2.  Multidimensional @GrB matrices
% are not supported.  C = cat (2,A,B) is the same as C = [A,B], and
% C = cat (1,A,B) is the same as C = [A;B].
%
% C = cat (dim, A1, A2, A3 ...) is the same as [A1,A2,A3,...] if dim
% is 2, and [A1;A2;A3;...] if dim is 1.
%
% If A and B are @GrB matrices and S = {A B} is a cell array, then
% C = cat (dim, S) does not trigger the @GrB/cat method, but uses
% the built-in method instead.  Use GrB.cell2mat instead.
%
% If the matrices have different types, the type is determined
% according to the rules in GrB.optype.
%
% Example:
%
%   A = GrB (magic (3))
%   B = GrB (pascal (3))
%   C1 = [A ; B]
%   C2 = cat (1, A, B)
%   assert (isequal (C1, C2)) ;
%   C1 = [A B]
%   C2 = cat (2, A, B)
%   assert (isequal (C1, C2)) ;
%
% See also GrB/horzcat, GrB/vertcat, GrB.cell2mat, GrB/mat2cell,
% GrB/num2cell.
