function s = norm (G, kind)
%NORM matrix or vector norm.
% If G is a matrix:
%
%   norm (G,1) is the maximum sum of the columns of abs (G).
%   norm (G,inf) is the maximum sum of the rows of abs (G).
%   norm (G,'fro') is the Frobenius norm of G: the sqrt of the sum of the
%       squares of the entries in G.
%   The 2-norm is not available for either MATLAB or GraphBLAS sparse
%       matrices.
%
% If G is a row or column vector:
%
%   norm (G,1) is the sum of abs (G)
%   norm (G,2) is the sqrt of the sum of G.^2
%   norm (G,inf) is the maximum of abs (G)
%   norm (G,-inf) is the minimum of abs (G)
%
% The p-norm for vectors is not yet supported.

% See also GrB.reduce, GrB.normdiff.
