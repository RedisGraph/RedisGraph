function e = nzmax (G)
%NZMAX maximum number of entries in a matrix.
% Since the GraphBLAS data structure is opaque, nzmax (G) has no
% particular meaning.  Thus, nzmax (G) is simply max (GrB.entries (G), 1).
% It appears as an overloaded operator for a GrB matrix simply for
% compatibility with built-in sparse matrices.

% See also GrB/nnz, GrB.entries, GrB.nonz.
