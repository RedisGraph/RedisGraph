function C = bitset (A, B, arg3, arg4)
%BITSET set bit.
% C = bitset (A,B) sets a bit in A to 1, where the bit position is
% determined by B.  A is an integer array.  If B(i,j) is an integer in the
% range 1 (the least significant bit) to the number of bits in the data
% type of A, then C(i,j) is equal to the value of A(i,j) after setting the
% bit to 1.  If B(i,j) is outside this range, C(i,j) is set to A(i,j),
% unmodified; note that this behavior is an extension of the built-in
% bitset, which results in an error for this case.  This modified
% rule allows the inputs A and B to be sparse.
%
% If A and B are matrices, the pattern of C is the set union of A
% and B.  If one of A or B is a nonzero scalar, the scalar is expanded
% into a sparse matrix with the same pattern as the other matrix, and the
% result is a sparse matrix.
%
% If the last input argument is a string, C = bigset (A,B,assumedtype)
% provides a data type to convert A to if it has a floating-point type.
% If A already has an integer type, then it is not modified.  Otherwise, A
% is converted to assumedtype, which can be 'int8', 'int16', 'int32',
% 'int64', 'uint8', 'uint16', 'uint32' or 'uint64'.  The default is
% 'uint64'.
%
% C = bitset (A,B,V) sets the bit in A(i,j) at position B(i,j) to 0 if
% V(i,j) is zero, or to 1 if V(i,j) is nonzero.  If V is a scalar, it
% is implicitly expanded to V * spones (B).
%
% All four arguments may be used, as C = bitset (A,B,V,assumedtype).
%
% Example:
%
%   A = GrB (magic (4), 'uint8')
%   B = reshape ([1:8 1:8], 4, 4)
%   C = bitset (A, B)
%   fprintf ('\nA: ') ; fprintf ('%3x ', A) ; fprintf ('\n') ;
%   fprintf ('\nB: ') ; fprintf ('%3x ', B) ; fprintf ('\n') ;
%   fprintf ('\nC: ') ; fprintf ('%3x ', C) ; fprintf ('\n') ;
%   C2 = bitset (uint8 (A), B)
%   isequal (C2, C)
