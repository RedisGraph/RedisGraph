function C = hypot (A, B)
%HYPOT robust computation of the square root of sum of squares.
% C = hypot (A,B) computes sqrt (abs (A).^2 + abs (B).^2) accurately.
% If A and B are matrices, the pattern of C is the set union of A and B.
% If one of A or B is a nonzero scalar, the scalar is expanded into a
% full matrix the size of the other matrix, and the result is a full
% matrix.
