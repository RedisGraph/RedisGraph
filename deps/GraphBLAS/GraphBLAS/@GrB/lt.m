function C = lt (A, B)
%A < B less than.
% C = (A < B) is an element-by-element comparison of A and B.  One or
% both may be scalars.  Otherwise, A and B must have the same size.
%
% See also GrB/le, GrB/gt, GrB/ge, GrB/ne, GrB/eq.

% FUTURE: lt(A,B) for two matrices A and B is slower than it could be.
% See comments in gb_union_op.

% The pattern of C depends on the type of inputs:
% A scalar, B scalar:  C is scalar.
% A scalar, B matrix:  C is full if A<0, otherwise C is a subset of B.
% B scalar, A matrix:  C is full if B>0, otherwise C is a subset of A.
% A matrix, B matrix:  C has the pattern of the set union, A+B.
