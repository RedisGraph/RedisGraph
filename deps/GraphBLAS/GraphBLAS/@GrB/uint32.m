function C = uint32 (G)
%UINT32 cast a GraphBLAS matrix to built-in full uint32 matrix.
% C = uint32 (G) typecasts the GrB matrix G to a built-in full uint32
% matrix.  The result C is full since sparse uint32 matrices are not
% built-in.
%
% To typecast the matrix G to a GraphBLAS sparse uint32 matrix instead,
% use C = GrB (G, 'uint32').
