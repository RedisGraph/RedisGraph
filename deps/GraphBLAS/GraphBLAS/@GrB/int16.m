function C = int16 (G)
%INT16 cast a GraphBLAS matrix to built-in full int16 matrix.
% C = int16 (G) typecasts the GrB matrix G to a built-in full int16
% matrix.  The result C is full since sparse int16 matrices are not
% built-in.
%
% To typecast the matrix G to a GraphBLAS sparse int16 matrix instead,
% use C = GrB (G, 'int16').
