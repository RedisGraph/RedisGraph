function x = gb_scalar (A)
%GB_SCALAR get contents of a scalar
% x = gb_scalar (A).  A may be a built-in scalar or a GraphBLAS
% scalar as a struct (not an object).  Returns the result x
% as a built-in non-sparse scalar.  If the scalar has no entry
% (the built-in sparse(0)), then x is returned as zero.
