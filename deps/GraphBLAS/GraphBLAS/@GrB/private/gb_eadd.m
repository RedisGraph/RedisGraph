function C = gb_eadd (A, op, B)
%GB_EADD C = A+B, sparse matrix 'addition' using the given op.
% The pattern of C is the set union of A and B.  This method assumes the
% identity value of the op is zero.  That is, x+0 = x+0 = x.  The binary
% operator op is only applied to entries in the intersection of the
% pattern of A and B.
%
% The inputs A and B are built-in matrices or GraphBLAS structs (not GrB
% objects).  The result is a typically a GraphBLAS struct.
%
% See also GrB/plus, GrB/minus, GrB/bitxor, GrB/bitor, GrB/hypot.
