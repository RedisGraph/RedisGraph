function C = int8 (G)
%INT8 cast a GraphBLAS matrix to built-in full int8 matrix.
% C = int8 (G) typecasts the GrB matrix G to a built-in full int8 matrix.
% The result C is full since sparse int8 matrices are not built-in.
%
% To typecast the matrix G to a GraphBLAS sparse int8 matrix instead, use
% C = GrB (G, 'int8').
