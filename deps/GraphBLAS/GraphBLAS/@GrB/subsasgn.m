function C = subsasgn (C, S, A)
%SUBSASGN C(I,J) = A or C(I) = A; assign submatrix.
% C(I,J) = A assigns A into the C(I,J) submatrix of the GraphBLAS matrix
% C.  A must be either a matrix of size length(I)-by-length(J), or a
% scalar.  Note that C(I,J) = 0 differs from C(I,J) = sparse (0).  The
% former places an explicit entry with value zero in all positions of
% C(I,J).  The latter deletes all entries in C(I,J).  With a MATLAB
% sparse matrix C, both statements delete all entries in C(I,J) since
% MATLAB never stores explicit zeros in its sparse matrices.
%
% With a single index, C(I) = A, both C and A must be vectors; linear
% indexing is not yet supported.  In this case A must either be a vector
% of length the same as I, or a scalar.
%
% If M is a logical matrix, C (M) = x is an assignment via logical
% indexing, where C and M have the same size, and x(:) is either a vector
% of length nnz (M), or a scalar.
%
% C (M) = A (M), where the logical matrix M is used on both the sides of
% the assignment, is the same as C = GrB.subassign (C, M, A).  If C and A
% (or M) are GraphBLAS matrices, C (M) = A (M) uses GraphBLAS via operator
% overloading.  The statement C (M) = A (M) takes about twice the time as
% C = GrB.subassign (C, M, A), so the latter is preferred for best
% performance.  However, both methods in GraphBLAS are many thousands of
% times faster than C (M) = A (M) using purely MATLAB sparse matrices C, M,
% and A, when the matrices are large.
%
% If I or J are very large colon notation expressions, then C(I,J)=A is
% not possible, because MATLAB creates I and J as explicit lists first.
% See GrB.subassign instead.  See also the example with 'help GrB.extract'.
%
% Unlike the MATLAB C(I,J)=A, the GraphBLAS assignment does not change
% the size of C.
