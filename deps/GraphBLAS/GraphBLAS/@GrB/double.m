function C = double (G)
%DOUBLE cast a GraphBLAS matrix to a built-in double matrix.
% C = double (G) typecasts the GraphBLAS matrix G into a built-in
% double matrix C, either real or complex.  C is full if all
% entries in G are present, and sparse otherwise.
%
% To typecast the matrix G to a GraphBLAS double (real) matrix
% instead, use C = GrB (G, 'double').  Explicit zeros are kept in C.
