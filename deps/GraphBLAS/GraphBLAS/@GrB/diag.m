function C = diag (A, k)
%DIAG diagonal matrices and diagonals of a matrix.
% C = diag (v,k) when v is a vector with n components is a square sparse
% matrix of dimension n+abs(k), with the elements of v on the kth
% diagonal. The main diagonal is k = 0; k > 0 is above the diagonal, and
% k < 0 is below the main diagonal.  C = diag (v) is the same as
% C = diag (v,0).
%
% c = diag (A,k) when A is a matrix returns a column vector c formed the
% entries on the kth diagonal of A.  The main diagonal is c = diag (A).
%
% The GraphBLAS diag function always constructs a GraphBLAS sparse
% matrix, unlike the built-in diag, which always constructs a full
% matrix.  To use this overloaded function for a non-@GrB sparse matrix
% A, use C = diag (A, GrB (k)) ;
%
% Examples:
%
%   C1 = diag (GrB (1:10, 'uint8'), 2)
%   C2 = sparse (diag (1:10, 2))
%   nothing = double (C1-C2)
%
%   A = magic (8)
%   full (double ([diag(A,1) diag(GrB(A),1)]))
%
%   m = 5 ;
%   f = ones (2*m,1) ;
%   A = diag(-m:m) + diag(f,1) + diag(f,-1)
%   G = diag(GrB(-m:m)) + diag(GrB(f),1) + diag(GrB(f),-1)
%   nothing = double (A-G)
