function DiGraph = digraph (G, option)
%DIGRAPH convert a GraphBLAS matrix into a MATLAB directed DiGraph.
% DiGraph = digraph (G) converts a GraphBLAS matrix G into a directed
% MATLAB DiGraph.  G must be square.  If G is logical, then no weights are
% added to the DiGraph.  If G is single or double, these become the weights
% of the MATLAB DiGraph.  If G is integer, the DiGraph is constructed with
% weights of type double.
%
% DiGraph = digraph (G, 'omitselfloops') ignores the diagonal of G, and the
% resulting MATLAB DiGraph has no self-edges.  The default is that
% self-edges are created from any diagonal entries of G.
%
% Example:
%
%   G = GrB (sprand (8, 8, 0.2))
%   DiGraph = digraph (G)
%   h = plot (DiGraph) ;
%   h.NodeFontSize = 20 ;
%   h.ArrowSize = 20 ;
%   h.LineWidth = 2 ;
%   h.EdgeColor = [0 0 1] ;
%   t = title ('random directed graph with 8 nodes') ;
%   t.FontSize = 20 ;
%
