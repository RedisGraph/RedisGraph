function c = chunk (c)
%GRB.CHUNK get/set the chunk size to use in GraphBLAS.

%
% GrB.chunk gets and/or sets the chunk size to use in GraphBLAS, which
% controls how many threads GraphBLAS uses for small problems.  The
% default is 4096.  If w is a measure of the work required (for C=A+B, the
% work is w = GrB.entries(A) + GrB.entries(B), for example) then the number
% of threads GraphBLAS uses is min (max (1, floor (w/c)), GrB.nthreads).
%
% Changing the chunk via GrB.chunk(c) causes all subsequent GraphBLAS
% operations to use that chunk size c.  The setting persists for the
% current session, or until 'clear all' or GrB.clear is used, at
% which point the setting reverts to the default.
