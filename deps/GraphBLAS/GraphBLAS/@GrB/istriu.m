function s = istriu (G)
%ISTRIU determine if a matrix is upper triangular.
% istriu (G) is true if all entries in G are on or above the diagonal.  A
% GraphBLAS matrix G may have explicit zeros.  If these appear in the lower
% triangular part of G, then istriu (G) is false, but istriu (double (G))
% can be true since double (G) drops those entries.

% FUTURE: this will be much faster when written as a mexFunction
