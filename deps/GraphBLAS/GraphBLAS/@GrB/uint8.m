function C = uint8 (G)
%UINT8 cast a GraphBLAS matrix to built-in full uint8 matrix.
% C = uint8 (G) typecasts the GrB matrix G to a built-in full uint8
% matrix.  The result C is full since sparse uint8 matrices are not
% built-in.
%
% To typecast the matrix G to a GraphBLAS sparse uint8 matrix instead, use
% C = GrB (G, 'uint8').

% GrB/uint64.
