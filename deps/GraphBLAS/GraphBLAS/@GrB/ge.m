function C = ge (A, B)
%A >= B Greater than or equal to.
% C = (A >= B) is an element-by-element comparison of A and B.  One or
% both may be scalars.  Otherwise, A and B must have the same size.
%
% The input matrices may be either GraphBLAS and/or MATLAB matrices, in
% any combination.  C is returned as a GraphBLAS matrix.
