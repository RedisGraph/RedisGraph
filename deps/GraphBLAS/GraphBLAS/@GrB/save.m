%GRB.SAVE Save a single GraphBLAS matrix to a file.
% GrB.save (C) saves a single @GrB or built-in matrix C to a file, with a
% filename of 'C.mat' that matches the matrix name.  If C is an
% expression, the filename 'GrB_Matrix.mat' is used.  A second parameter
% allows for the selection of a different filename, as GrB.save (C,
% 'myfile.mat').  If A is not already a @GrB matrix, it is converted to
% one with GrB(A).
%
% The object or matrix C is saved as a struct containing the opaque
% contents of the GrB object, which is then reconstructed by GrB.load.  A
% matrix saved to a file with GrB.save must be loaded back with GrB.load.
% It cannot be loaded with the built-in load method.
%
% Example:
%
%   A = magic (4) ;
%   GrB.save (A) ;              % A can be a @GrB or built-in matrix
%   clear all
%   A = GrB.load ('A.mat') ;    % A is now a @GrB matrix
%
% See also GrB.load, GrB/struct.
