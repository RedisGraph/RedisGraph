function C = logical (G)
%LOGICAL typecast a GraphBLAS matrix to MATLAB logical matrix.
% C = logical (G) typecasts the GraphBLAS matrix G to into a MATLAB
% logical matrix.  C is full if all entries in G are present, and
% sparse otherwise.
%
% To typecast the matrix G to a GraphBLAS logical matrix instead,
% use C = GrB (G, 'logical').
