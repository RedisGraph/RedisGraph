function C = times (A, B)
%TIMES C = A.*B, sparse matrix element-wise multiplication.
% C = A.*B computes the element-wise multiplication of A and B.  If both
% A and B are matrices, the pattern of C is the intersection of A and B.
% If one is a scalar, the pattern of C is the same as the pattern of the
% one matrix.
