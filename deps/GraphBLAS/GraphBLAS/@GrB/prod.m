function C = prod (G, option)
%PROD product of elements.
% C = prod (G), where G is an m-by-n matrix, is a 1-by-n row vector C where
% C(j) is the product of all entries in G(:,j).  If G is a row or column
% vector, then prod (G) is a scalar product of all the entries in the
% vector.
%
% C = prod (G,'all') takes the product of all elements of G to a single
% scalar.
%
% C = prod (G,1) is the default when G is a matrix, which is to take the
% product of each column, giving a 1-by-n row vector.  If G is already a
% row vector, then C = G.
%
% C = prod (G,2) takes the product of each row, resulting in an m-by-1
% column vector C where C(i) is the product of all entries in G(i,:).
%
% The built-in MATLAB prod (A, ... type, nanflag) allows for different
% kinds of products to be computed, and the NaN behavior can be specified.
% The GraphBLAS prod (G,...) uses only a type of 'native', and a nanflag of
% 'includenan'.  See 'help prod' for more details.
