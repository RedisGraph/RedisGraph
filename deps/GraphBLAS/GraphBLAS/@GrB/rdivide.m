function C = rdivide (A, B)
%RDIVIDE C = A./B, sparse matrix element-wise division.
% C = A./B when B is a matrix results in a full matrix C, with all
% entries present.  If A is a matrix and B is a scalar, then C has the
% pattern of A, except if B is zero and A is double, single, or complex.
% In that case, since 0/0 is NaN, C is a full matrix.
