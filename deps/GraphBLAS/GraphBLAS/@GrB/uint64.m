function C = uint64 (G)
%UINT64 cast a GraphBLAS matrix to built-in full uint64 matrix.
% C = uint64 (G) typecasts the GrB matrix G to a built-in full uint64
% matrix.  The result C is full since sparse uint64 matrices are not
% built-in.
%
% To typecast the matrix G to a GraphBLAS sparse uint64 matrix instead,
% use C = GrB (G, 'uint64').
