% MATLAB interface for SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS
%
% GraphBLAS is a library for creating graph algorithms based on sparse linear
% algebraic operations over semirings.  Its MATLAB interface provides faster
% sparse matrix operations than the built-in methods in MATLAB, as well as
% sparse integer and single-precision matrices, and operations with arbitrary
% semirings.  See 'help GrB' for details.
%
% The constructor method is GrB.  If A is any matrix (GraphBLAS, MATLAB sparse
% or full), then:
%
%   C = GrB (A) ;            GraphBLAS copy of a matrix A, same type
%   C = GrB (m, n) ;         m-by-n GraphBLAS double matrix with no entries
%   C = GrB (..., type) ;    create or typecast to a different type
%   C = GrB (..., format) ;  create in a specified format
%
% The type can be 'double', 'single', 'logical', 'int8', 'int16', 'int32',
% 'int64', 'uint8', 'uint16', 'uint32', 'uint64', 'double complex' or 'single
% complex'.  Typical formats are 'by row' or 'by col'. 
%
% Essentially all operators and many built-in MATLAB functions are overloaded
% by the @GrB class, so that they can be used for GraphBLAS matrices.
% See 'help GrB' for more details.
