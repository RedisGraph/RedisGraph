function gbdemo2 (bnz)
%GBDEMO2 Extreme performance differences: GraphBLAS vs MATLAB.
%
% Usage:
%
%       gbdemo2             % uses a default bnz = 6000
%       gbdemo2 (20000)     % uses bnz = 20000
%
% The GraphBLAS operations used in gbdemo are perhaps 3x to 50x
% faster than the corresponding MATLAB operations, depending on how
% many cores your computer has.  Here's an example where GraphBLAS is
% asymptotically far faster than MATLAB R2019a: a simple assignment
% for a large matrix C:
%
%       C(I,J) = A
%
% The matrix C is constructed via C = kron (B,B) where nnz (B) is
% roughly the bnz provided on input (with a default of bnz = 6000),
% so that C will have about bnz^2 entries, or 36 million by default.
% I and J are chosen randomly, and A is 5000-by-5000.
%
% When the problem becomes large, MATLAB will take a very long time.
% If you have enough memory, and want to see higher speedups in
% GraphBLAS, increase bnz (and be prepared to wait even longer).
% With the default bnz = 6000, this test takes about 4GB of RAM.
%
% On my Dell XPS 4-core laptop (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U, 16GB
% RAM), using MATLAB R2019a, when C becomes 9 million by 9 million,
% the computation C(I,J)=A for MATLAB matrices C, I, J, and A takes
% several minutes, whereas GraphBLAS takes less than a second, or
% about 500x faster than MATLAB.  On a desktop with an Intel(R)
% Xeon(R) CPU E5-2698 v4 @ 2.20GHz with 20 hardware cores, the
% speedup over MATLAB is even more dramatic (up to 2,660x has been
% observed).
