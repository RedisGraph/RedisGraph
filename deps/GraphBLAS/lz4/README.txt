Notes by Tim Davis, on inclusion of LZ4 into SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS:

This directory contains a minimal copy of lz4 v1.9.3, from
https://github.com/lz4/lz4.git and http://www.lz4.org, by Yann Collet.  See
./LICENSE and ./README.md for more details.  Four source files are used in
SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS: lz4/lib/lz4.[ch], and lz4/lib/lz4hc.[ch] copied here
unmodified from v1.9.3, which are under the BSD-2-clause license.

When LZ4 is compiled for use in SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS,
LZ4_USER_MEMORY_FUNCTIONS is defined, and LZ4_malloc, LZ4_calloc, and LZ4_free,
are provided to LZ4.  Those functions use whatever memory manager is given to
GxB_init, or the ANSI C11 malloc/calloc/free for GrB_init.

This compile-time change could cause a conflict if LZ4 is also installed as a
system-wide library.  To avoid the conflict, all LZ4 function names are renamed
to GB_LZ4_*, using #defines in ../Source/GB_lz4.c.  SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS will
use this version of LZ4, integrated into the libgraphblas.so (.dylib, .dll),
rather than a separate liblz4.so library.
