function test182
%TEST182 test for internal wait that changes w from sparse/hyper to bitmap/full
%
% This test triggers the C<M>=A assignment where C starts out as sparse with
% has many pending tuples, and is converted to bitmap just before the
% assignment.  In this case, C is the vector w.  If w_sparsity is 15 and 'wait'
% is false, then it starts the w<v>=sum(A) reduction with many pending tuples,
% and converts w from sparse/hyper with many pending tuples into a bitmap
% vector.  The outputs w, v, and A should be the same, regardless of the input
% parameter s.
%
% The internal condition is triggered if wait is false, and w_sparsity
% is 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, or 15:
%
%   5:  4+1         bitmap (4) or hypersparse (1)
%   6:  4+2         bitmap (4) or sparse (2)
%   7:  4+2+1       bitmap (4), sparse (2), or hypersparse (1)
%  13:  8+4+1       full (8), bitmap (4) or hypersparse (1)
%  14:  8+4+2       full (8), bitmap (4) or sparse (2)
%  15:  8+4+2+1     full (8), bitmap (4), sparse (2), or hypersparse (1)
%
% That is, the sparsity control for w allows it to change from sparse/hyper
% (with pending updates) to/from bitmap.  If 'wait' is true, then GB_mex_gabor
% does an explicit GrB_Vector_wait (&w) before the w<v>=sum(A) reduction, so
% w is converted to bitmap before the assignment, not during, and the internal
% condition is not triggered.
%
% s is an optional vector of length 4, containing 4 parameters:
% s = [wait, w_sparsity, v_sparsity, A_sparsity] ;
% with wait 0 or 1, and the sparsity controls in range 1 to 15.
%
% The sparsity control for A and v has no effect on this condition.
%
% This test case comes from Gabor Szarnyas and Marton Elekes.
