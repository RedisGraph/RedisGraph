function Cout = GB_spec_matrix (Cin, identity)
%GB_SPEC_MATRIX a MATLAB mimic that conforms a matrix to the GraphBLAS spec
%
% Cout = GB_spec_matrix (Cin)
% Cout = GB_spec_matrix (Cin, identity)
%
% Conforms an input matrix to the GraphBLAS spec, for use in GB_spec_*
% functions only.
%
% The identity argument is the addititive identity of the semiring that will be
% used on the matrix (default is zero).  It represents the value of the
% implicit 'zeros' that are not present in a sparse matrix.
%
% The input Cin is either a matrix or a struct.
%
% If Cin is a struct, it must have a field Cin.matrix, and it can have two
% optional fields, Cin.pattern and Cin.class.  Let X = Cin.matrix.  The class
% of X is given by Cin.class, if present, or class(X) otherwise.  For a dense
% X, class(X) and Cin.class, if present, must match.  If present, the pattern
% of X is given by Cin.pattern; otherwise the pattern for a sparse X is
% spones(X) and entries outside the pattern are assumed to be equal to
% identity.  For a dense X, with no Cin.pattern present the pattern of X is
% just X ~= identity.
%
% Cin is a matrix, then its class is given by class (Cin).  If the matrix is
% sparse, its pattern is spones(Cin) and entries not in the pattern are assumed
% equal to identity.  Otherwise the pattern of Cin is given by Cin ~= identity.
%
% The output Cout is a struct with all three fields present (matrix, pattern,
% and class).  Cout.matrix is dense, and it has been typecast into the class
% given by Cout.class.  Entries not in the pattern of X are explicitly set to
% identity.
%
% The matrix is typecast to Cout.class using the typecasting GraphBLAS
% typecasting rules, which differ from MATLAB's rules, particular for integer
% types.  Since MATLAB can only represent 'logical' and 'double' sparse
% matries, the matrix is converted to full.
%
% Converting a matrix from sparse to full is not part of the GraphBLAS spec, of
% course.  Neither is the identity value a part of the matrix structure in
% GraphBLAS.  A matrix in GraphBLAS is always sparse, and entries not in the
% pattern are always implicitly equal to whatever semiring is used on the
% sparse matrix.  As a result, GraphBLAS never needs to know what the identity
% value is until it operates on the matrix, and the identity is not part of the
% matrix itself.  Using a different semiring immediately changes the value of
% the implicit zero, with a change to the GraphBLAS data structure for the
% matrix.
%
% However, MATLAB only supports logical and double sparse matrices, so to
% preserve the class behavior, the MATLAB mimic functions GB_spec_* operate
% only on dense matrices.  When a MATLAB sparse matrix is converted into a
% dense matri , the entries not in the pattern must be set to an explicit
% value: the addititive identity.
%
% The MATLAB mimic routines, GB_spec_* are written almost purely in M, and
% do not call GraphBLAS functions (with the exception of typecasting and
% operators).  They always return a stuct C with a dense C.matrix, a
% pattern C.pattern and class C.class.
%
% GraphBLAS GB_mex_* functions are direct interfaces to the C functions in
% GraphBLAS, and they always return a sparse struct; otherwise large problems
% could not be solved.  The struct contains just C.matrix and C.class.  The
% pattern of C.matrix is spones(C.matrix).  To compare the output C0 of
% a GB_mex_* function with C1 of a GrapBLAS_spec_* function, the struct C0
% must first be passed to this function, C0=GB_spec_matrix(C0,identity) and
% then C0 and C1 should be identical.
