% compares two structs C_spec and C_mex.  The C_spec struct contains a dense
% matrix and is the output of a MATLAB mimic, C_spec = GB_spec_* (...) for
% some GraphBLAS method.  C_mex = GrG_mex_* (...) is the output of the
% corresponding MATLAB interface to the true GraphBLAS method, in C.

% Convert C_mex from a sparse matrix into a dense matrix.  It will have
% explicit identity values where entries were not in the pattern of the sparse
% C_mex.matrix.  Entries outside the pattern are "don't care" values.  They may
% differ between C_spec and C_mex, because the latter works on dense matrices
% and thus must compute the entries.  With typecasting, an identity value may
% get modified.  C_mex, on the other hand, is computed in a GraphBLAS sparse
% matrix, and never appears.  It is only converted here to a dense matrix, with
% the implicit entries being replaced with identity.  C_spec is also converted,
% using the same identity value.
