%GB_SPEC_VXM a MATLAB mimic of GrB_vxm

% Usage:
% w = GB_spec_vxm (w, mask, accum, semiring, u, A, descriptor)
%
% w, mask, and u are column vectors.  Computes w'=u'*A or w'=u'*A'

% In the C implementation of GraphBLAS itself, the column vectors u and w are
% not transposed since it is costly to transpose column vectors.  w=A*u or
% w=A'*u is computed instead, but with the multiply operator fmult(x,y) used as
% fmult(y,x) instead.  This also requires the descriptor to be revised for A.
%
% The transformation of the problem in the C implementation is the same as
% simply doing the transpose of u and w and leaving the descriptor unchanged.
% Then the inputs to the multiply operator are used as-is and not flipped.
% This simpler method is used in this MATLAB mimic.
