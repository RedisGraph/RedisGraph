# Client Libraries

The full functionality of RedisGraph is available through `redis-cli` and the Redis API, but a number of client libraries have been written to improve abstractions and allow for a more natural experience in a project's native language. Additionally, these clients take advantage of some RedisGraph features that may reduce network throughput in some circumstances.

## Implementing a client

Information on some of the tasks involved in writing a RedisGraph client can be found in the [Client Specification](client_spec.md).
