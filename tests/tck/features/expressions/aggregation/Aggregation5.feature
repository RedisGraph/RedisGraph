Feature: Aggregation5 - Collect

  Scenario: [1] `collect()` filtering nulls
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[:NOT_EXIST]->(x)
      RETURN n, collect(x)
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | n  | collect(x) |
      | () | []         |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] OPTIONAL MATCH and `collect()` on node property
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:DoesExist {num: 42})
      CREATE (:DoesExist {num: 43})
      CREATE (:DoesExist {num: 44})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      OPTIONAL MATCH (f:DoesExist)
      OPTIONAL MATCH (n:DoesNotExist)
      RETURN collect(DISTINCT n.num) AS a, collect(DISTINCT f.num) AS b
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a  | b            |
      | [] | [42, 43, 44] |
    And no side effects
