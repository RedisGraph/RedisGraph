Feature: Aggregation1 - Count

  Scenario: [1] Count only non-null values
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({name: 'a', num: 33})
      CREATE ({name: 'a'})
      CREATE ({name: 'b', num: 42})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN n.name, count(n.num)
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | n.name | count(n.num) |
      | 'a'    | 1            |
      | 'b'    | 1            |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Counting loop relationships
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (a), (a)-[:R]->(a)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH ()-[r]-()
      RETURN count(r)
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | count(r) |
      | 1        |
    And no side effects
