Feature: Aggregation2 - Min and Max

  Scenario: [1] `max()` over integers
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      UNWIND [1, 2, 0, null, -1] AS x
      RETURN max(x)
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | max(x) |
      | 2      |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] `min()` over integers
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      UNWIND [1, 2, 0, null, -1] AS x
      RETURN min(x)
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | min(x) |
      | -1     |

      """
      UNWIND [1.0, 2.0, 0.5, null] AS x
      RETURN max(x)
