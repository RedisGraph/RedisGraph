Feature: List12 - List Comprehension

  @crash
  Scenario: [1] Collect and extract using a list comprehension
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:Label1 {name: 'original'})

    When executing query:

    Then the result should be, in any order:

    And the side effects should be:
      | +properties | 1 |
      | -properties | 1 |
