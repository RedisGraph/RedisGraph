Feature: List1 - Dynamic Element Access
# Dynamic element access refers to the bracket-operator – <expression resulting in a list>[<expression resulting in an integer>] – irrespectively of whether the list index – i.e. <expression resulting in an integer> – could be evaluated statically in a given scenario.

  Scenario: [1] Indexing into literal list
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN [1, 2, 3][0] AS value
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | value |
      | 1     |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Indexing into nested literal lists
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN [[1]][0][0]
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | [[1]][0][0] |
      | 1           |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [3] Use list lookup based on parameters when there is no type information
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | expr | ['Apa'] |
      | idx  | 0       |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[idx] AS value
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | value |
      | 'Apa' |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [4] Use list lookup based on parameters when there is lhs type information
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | idx | 0 |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH ['Apa'] AS expr
      RETURN expr[$idx] AS value
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | value |
      | 'Apa' |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [5] Use list lookup based on parameters when there is rhs type information
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | expr | ['Apa'] |
      | idx  | 0       |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[toInteger(idx)] AS value
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:

      | 'Apa' |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [6] Fail at runtime when attempting to index with a String into a List
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | expr | ['Apa'] |
      | idx  | 'name'  |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[idx]

    Then a TypeError should be raised at runtime: ListElementAccessByNonInteger

  Scenario: [7] Fail at runtime when trying to index into a list with a list
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | expr | ['Apa'] |
      | idx  | ['Apa'] |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[idx]
      """
    Then a TypeError should be raised at compile time: ListElementAccessByNonInteger

  Scenario: [8] Fail at compile time when attempting to index with a non-integer into a list
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] AS list, 3.14 AS idx
      RETURN list[idx]
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: ListElementAccessByNonInteger

  Scenario: [9] Fail at runtime when trying to index something which is not a list
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | expr | 100 |
      | idx  | 0   |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[idx]
      """
    Then a TypeError should be raised at runtime: InvalidArgumentType
