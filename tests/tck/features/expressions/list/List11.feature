Feature: List11 - Create a list from a range

  Scenario Outline: [1] Create list from `range()` with default step
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN range(<start>, <end>) AS list
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | list   |
      | <list> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | start | end   | list                                         |
