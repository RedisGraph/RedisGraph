Feature: List4 - List Concatenation

  Scenario: [1] Concatenating lists of same type
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN [1, 10, 100] + [4, 5] AS foo
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | foo                |
      | [1, 10, 100, 4, 5] |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Concatenating a list with a scalar of same type
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN [false, true] + false AS foo
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | foo                  |
      | [false, true, false] |
    And no side effects
