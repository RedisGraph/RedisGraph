Feature: Graph8 - Property keys function

  @skip
  Scenario: [1] Using `keys()` on a single node, non-empty result
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({name: 'Andres', surname: 'Lopez'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      UNWIND keys(n) AS x
      RETURN DISTINCT x AS theProps
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | theProps  |
      | 'name'    |
      | 'surname' |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [2] Using `keys()` on multiple nodes, non-empty result
    Given an empty graph

             ({otherName: 'Andres', otherSurname: 'Lopez'})
