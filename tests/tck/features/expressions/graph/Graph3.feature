Feature: Graph3 - Node labels

    # similar to Create1.[1] => rename to make clear labels() is tested

  Scenario: [1] Creating node without label
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (node)
      RETURN labels(node)
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | labels(node) |
      | []           |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes | 1 |

  # similar to Create1.[3]/[4] => rename to make clear labels() is tested

  Scenario: [2] Creating node with two labels
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (node:Foo:Bar {name: 'Mattias'})
      RETURN labels(node)
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:

      | ['Foo', 'Bar'] |
    And the side effects should be:

      | +properties | 1 |

  Scenario: [3] Ignore space when creating node with labels
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (node :Foo:Bar)

    Then the result should be, in any order:

      | +nodes  | 1 |

  Scenario: [4] Create node with label in pattern

    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (n:Person)-[:OWNS]->(:Dog)

  Scenario: [5] Using `labels()` in return clauses
    Given an empty graph

  Scenario: [6] `labels()` should accept type Any
    Given an empty graph

    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      WITH [a, 1] AS list

    Then the result should be (ignoring element order for lists):
      | l              |

      | ['Foo', 'Bar'] |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [7] `labels()` on null node
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      OPTIONAL MATCH (n:DoesNotExist)

    When executing query:
