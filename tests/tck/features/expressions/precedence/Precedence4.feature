  Scenario Outline: [1] Null predicate takes precedence over comparison operator
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN null IS <null1> <comp> null IS <null2> AS a,
             (null IS <null1>) <comp> (null IS <null2>) AS b,
             (null IS <null1> <comp> null) IS <null2> AS c
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a       | b       | c       |
      | <right> | <right> | <wrong> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | null1    | comp | null2    | right | wrong |
      | NOT NULL | =    | NULL     | false | true  |
      | NULL     | <>   | NULL     | false | true  |
      | NULL     | <>   | NOT NULL | true  | false |

  Scenario: [2] Null predicate takes precedence over boolean negation
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN NOT null IS NULL AS a,
             NOT (null IS NULL) AS b,
             (NOT null) IS NULL AS c
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a     | b     | c    |
      | false | false | true |
    And no side effects

  Scenario Outline: [3] Null predicate takes precedence over binary boolean operator
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN <truth1> <op> <truth2> IS <null> AS a,
             <truth1> <op> (<truth2> IS <null>) AS b,

      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a       | b       | c       |
      | <right> | <right> | <wrong> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | truth1 | op  | truth2 | null     | right | wrong |
      | null   | AND | null   | NULL     | null  | true  |
      | null   | AND | true   | NULL     | false | true  |
      | false  | AND | false  | NOT NULL | false | true  |
      | null   | OR  | false  | NULL     | null  | true  |
      | true   | OR  | null   | NULL     | true  | false |
      | true   | XOR | null   | NOT NULL | true  | false |
      | true   | XOR | false  | NULL     | true  | false |
