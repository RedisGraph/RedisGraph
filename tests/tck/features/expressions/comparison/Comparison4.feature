  Scenario: [1] Handling long chains of operators
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (a:A {prop1: 3, prop2: 4})
      CREATE (b:B {prop1: 4, prop2: 5})
      CREATE (c:C {prop1: 4, prop2: 4})
      CREATE (a)-[:R]->(b)

    When executing query:

      MATCH (n)-->(m)
      WHERE n.prop1 < m.prop1 = n.prop2 <> m.prop2
      RETURN labels(m)

    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | labels(m) |
      | ['B']     |
    And no side effects
