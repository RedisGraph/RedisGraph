Feature: Path3 - Length of a path

  Scenario: [1] Return a var length path of length zero
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (a:A)-[:REL]->(b:B)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH p = (a)-[*0..1]->(b)
      RETURN a, b, length(p) AS l
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a    | b    | l |
      | (:A) | (:A) | 0 |
      | (:B) | (:B) | 0 |
      | (:A) | (:B) | 1 |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Failing when using `length()` on a node
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN length(n)
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: InvalidArgumentType

  @skip
  Scenario: [3] Failing when using `length()` on a relationship
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH ()-[r]->()
      RETURN length(r)
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: InvalidArgumentType
