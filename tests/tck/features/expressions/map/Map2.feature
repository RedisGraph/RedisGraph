Feature: Map2 - Dynamic Value Access
# Dynamic value access refers to the bracket-operator – <expression resulting in a map>'['<expression resulting in a string>']' – irrespectively of whether the map key – i.e. <expression resulting in a string> – could be evaluated statically in a given scenario.

  Scenario: [1] Dynamically access a field based on parameters when there is no type information
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | expr | {name: 'Apa'} |
      | idx  | 'name'        |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[idx] AS value
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | value |
      | 'Apa' |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Dynamically access a field based on parameters when there is rhs type information
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | expr | {name: 'Apa'} |
      | idx  | 'name'        |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[toString(idx)] AS value
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | value |
      | 'Apa' |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [3] Dynamically access a field on null results in null
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH null AS expr, 'x' AS idx
      RETURN expr[idx] AS value
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | value |
      | null  |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [4] Dynamically access a field with null results in null
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH {name: 'Mats'} AS expr, null AS idx
      RETURN expr[idx] AS value
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | value |
      | null  |
    And no side effects

  Scenario Outline: [5] Dynamically access a field is case-sensitive
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH <map> AS map
      RETURN map[<key>] AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result   |
      | <result> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | map                            | key    | result   |
      | {name: 'Mats', nome: 'Pontus'} | 'name' | 'Mats'   |
      | {name: 'Mats', Name: 'Pontus'} | 'name' | 'Mats'   |
      | {name: 'Mats', Name: 'Pontus'} | 'Name' | 'Pontus' |
      | {name: 'Mats', Name: 'Pontus'} | 'nAMe' | null     |
      | {name: 'Mats', nome: 'Pontus'} | 'null' | null     |
      | {null: 'Mats', NULL: 'Pontus'} | 'null' | 'Mats'   |
      | {null: 'Mats', NULL: 'Pontus'} | 'NULL' | 'Pontus' |

  Scenario: [6] Fail at runtime when attempting to index with an Int into a Map
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | expr | {name: 'Apa'} |
      | idx  | 0             |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[idx]
      """
    Then a TypeError should be raised at runtime: MapElementAccessByNonString

  Scenario: [7] Fail at runtime when trying to index into a map with a non-string
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | expr | {name: 'Apa'} |
      | idx  | 12.3          |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[idx]
      """
    Then a TypeError should be raised at runtime: MapElementAccessByNonString

  Scenario: [8] Fail at runtime when trying to index something which is not a map
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | expr | 100 |
      | idx  | 0   |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[idx]
      """
    Then a TypeError should be raised at runtime: InvalidArgumentType
