Feature: Map1 - Static value access
# Static value access refers to the dot-operator – <expression resulting in a map>.<identify> – which does not allow any dynamic computation of the map key – i.e. <identify>.

  Scenario: [1] Statically access a field of a non-null map
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH {existing: 42, notMissing: null} AS m
      RETURN m.missing, m.notMissing, m.existing
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | m.missing | m.notMissing | m.existing |
      | null      | null         | 42         |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Statically access a field of a null map
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH null AS m
      RETURN m.missing
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | m.missing |
      | null      |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [3] Statically access a field of a map resulting from an expression
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [123, {existing: 42, notMissing: null}] AS list
      RETURN (list[1]).missing, (list[1]).notMissing, (list[1]).existing
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | (list[1]).missing | (list[1]).notMissing | (list[1]).existing |
      | null              | null                 | 42                 |
    And no side effects

  Scenario Outline: [4] Statically access a field is case-sensitive
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH <map> AS map
      RETURN map.<key> AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result   |
      | <result> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | map                            | key  | result   |
      | {name: 'Mats', nome: 'Pontus'} | name | 'Mats'   |
      | {name: 'Mats', Name: 'Pontus'} | name | 'Mats'   |
      | {name: 'Mats', Name: 'Pontus'} | Name | 'Pontus' |
      | {name: 'Mats', Name: 'Pontus'} | nAMe | null     |

  Scenario Outline: [5] Statically access a field with a delimited identifier
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH <map> AS map
      RETURN map.<key> AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result   |
      | <result> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | map                            | key    | result   |
      | {name: 'Mats', nome: 'Pontus'} | `name` | 'Mats'   |
      | {name: 'Mats', nome: 'Pontus'} | `nome` | 'Pontus' |
      | {name: 'Mats', nome: 'Pontus'} | `Mats` | null     |
      | {name: 'Mats', nome: 'Pontus'} | `null` | null     |
      | {null: 'Mats', NULL: 'Pontus'} | `null` | 'Mats'   |
      | {null: 'Mats', NULL: 'Pontus'} | `NULL` | 'Pontus' |

  Scenario Outline: [6] Fail when performing property access on a non-map
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH <exp> AS nonMap
      RETURN nonMap.num
      """
    Then a TypeError should be raised at compile time: InvalidArgumentType

    Examples:
      | exp         |
      | 123         |
      | 42.45       |
      | true        |
      | false       |
      | 'string'    |
      | [123, true] |
