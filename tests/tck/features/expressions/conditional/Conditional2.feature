Feature: Conditional2 - Case Expression

  Scenario Outline: [1] Simple cases over integers
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN CASE <value>
          WHEN -10 THEN 'minus ten'
          WHEN 0 THEN 'zero'
          WHEN 1 THEN 'one'
          WHEN 5 THEN 'five'
          WHEN 10 THEN 'ten'
          WHEN 3000 THEN 'three thousand'
          ELSE 'something else'
        END AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result   |
      | <result> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | value | result           |
      | -10   | 'minus ten'      |
      | 0     | 'zero'           |
      | 1     | 'one'            |
      | 5     | 'five'           |
      | 10    | 'ten'            |
      | 3000  | 'three thousand' |
      | -30   | 'something else' |
      | 3     | 'something else' |
      | 3001  | 'something else' |
      | '0'   | 'something else' |
      | true  | 'something else' |
      | 10.1  | 'something else' |
