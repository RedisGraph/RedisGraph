Feature: Quantifier7 - Any quantifier interop

  Scenario Outline: [1] Any quantifier can nest itself and other quantifiers on nested lists
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN any(x IN [['abc'], ['abc', 'def']] WHERE <condition>) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result   |
      | <result> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | condition                      | result |
      | none(y IN x WHERE y = 'def')   | true   |
      | none(y IN x WHERE y = 'abc')   | false  |
      | single(y IN x WHERE y = 'def') | true   |
      | single(y IN x WHERE y = 'ghi') | false  |
      | any(y IN x WHERE y = 'abc')    | true   |
      | any(y IN x WHERE y = 'ghi')    | false  |
      | all(y IN x WHERE y = 'abc')    | true   |
      | all(y IN x WHERE y = 'def')    | false  |

  Scenario Outline: [2] Any quantifier can nest itself and other quantifiers on the same list
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] AS list
      RETURN any(x IN list WHERE <condition>) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result   |
      | <result> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | condition                         | result |
      | none(y IN list WHERE x = y * y)   | true   |
      | none(y IN list WHERE x % y = 0)   | false  |
      | single(y IN list WHERE x = y * y) | true   |
      | single(y IN list WHERE x < y * y) | false  |
      | any(y IN list WHERE x = y)        | true   |
      | any(y IN list WHERE x = 10 * y)   | false  |
      | all(y IN list WHERE x <= y)       | true   |
      | all(y IN list WHERE x < y)        | false  |

  Scenario Outline: [3] Any quantifier is true if the single or the all quantifier is true
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN (single(<operands>) OR all(<operands>)) <= any(<operands>) AS result
      """
    # Note that FALSE is less than TRUE, hence A <= B is effectively equivalent to the implication A -> B
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result |
      | true   |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | operands                                         |
      | x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE x = 2     |
      | x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE x % 2 = 0 |
      | x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE x % 3 = 0 |
      | x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE x < 7     |
      | x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE x >= 3    |

  Scenario Outline: [4] Any quantifier is equal the boolean negative of the none quantifier
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN any(x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE <predicate>) = (NOT none(x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE <predicate>)) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result |
      | true   |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | predicate |
      | x = 2     |
      | x % 2 = 0 |
      | x % 3 = 0 |
      | x < 7     |
      | x >= 3    |

  Scenario Outline: [5] Any quantifier is equal the boolean negative of the all quantifier on the boolean negative of the predicate
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN any(x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE <predicate>) = (NOT all(x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE NOT (<predicate>))) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result |
      | true   |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | predicate |
      | x = 2     |
      | x % 2 = 0 |
      | x % 3 = 0 |
      | x < 7     |
      | x >= 3    |

  Scenario Outline: [6] Any quantifier is equal whether the size of the list filtered with same the predicate is grater zero
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN any(x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE <predicate>) = (size([x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE <predicate> | x]) > 0) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result |
      | true   |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | predicate |
      | x = 2     |
      | x % 2 = 0 |
      | x % 3 = 0 |
      | x < 7     |
      | x >= 3    |
