Feature: Quantifier8 - All quantifier interop

  Scenario Outline: [1] All quantifier can nest itself and other quantifiers on nested lists
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN all(x IN [['abc'], ['abc', 'def']] WHERE <condition>) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result   |
      | <result> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | condition                      | result |
      | none(y IN x WHERE y = 'ghi')   | true   |
      | none(y IN x WHERE y = 'def')   | false  |
      | single(y IN x WHERE y = 'abc') | true   |
      | single(y IN x WHERE y = 'ghi') | false  |
      | any(y IN x WHERE y = 'abc')    | true   |
      | any(y IN x WHERE y = 'ghi')    | false  |
      | all(y IN x WHERE y <> 'ghi')   | true   |
      | all(y IN x WHERE y = 'abc')    | false  |

  Scenario Outline: [2] All quantifier can nest itself and other quantifiers on the same list
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] AS list
      RETURN all(x IN list WHERE <condition>) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result   |
      | <result> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | condition                            | result |
      | none(y IN list WHERE x = 10 * y)     | true   |
      | none(y IN list WHERE x = y)          | false  |
      | single(y IN list WHERE x = y)        | true   |
      | single(y IN list WHERE x < y)        | false  |
      | any(y IN list WHERE x % y = 0)       | true   |
      | any(y IN list WHERE x < y)           | false  |
      | all(y IN list WHERE abs(x - y) < 10) | true   |
      | all(y IN list WHERE x < y + 7)       | false  |

  Scenario Outline: [3] All quantifier is equal the none quantifier on the boolean negative of the predicate
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN all(x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE <predicate>) = none(x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE NOT (<predicate>)) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result |
      | true   |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | predicate |
      | x = 2     |
      | x % 2 = 0 |
      | x % 3 = 0 |
      | x < 7     |
      | x >= 3    |

  Scenario Outline: [4] All quantifier is equal the boolean negative of the any quantifier on the boolean negative of the predicate
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN all(x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE <predicate>) = (NOT any(x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE NOT (<predicate>))) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result |
      | true   |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | predicate |
      | x = 2     |
      | x % 2 = 0 |
      | x % 3 = 0 |
      | x < 7     |
      | x >= 3    |

  Scenario Outline: [5] All quantifier is equal whether the size of the list filtered with same the predicate is equal the size of the unfiltered list
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN all(x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE <predicate>) = (size([x IN [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] WHERE <predicate> | x]) = size([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])) AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result |
      | true   |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | predicate |
      | x = 2     |
      | x % 2 = 0 |
      | x % 3 = 0 |
      | x < 7     |
      | x >= 3    |
