Feature: TypeConversion3 - To Float

  @skip
  Scenario: [1] `toFloat()` on mixed number types
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [3.4, 3] AS numbers
      RETURN [n IN numbers | toFloat(n)] AS float_numbers
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | float_numbers |
      | [3.4, 3.0]    |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [2] `toFloat()` returning null on non-numerical string
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH 'foo' AS foo_string, '' AS empty_string
      RETURN toFloat(foo_string) AS foo, toFloat(empty_string) AS empty
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | foo  | empty |
      | null | null  |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [3] `toFloat()` handling Any type
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [3.4, 3, '5'] AS numbers
      RETURN [n IN numbers | toFloat(n)] AS float_numbers
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | float_numbers   |
      | [3.4, 3.0, 5.0] |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [4] `toFloat()` on a list of strings
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH ['1', '2', 'foo'] AS numbers
      RETURN [n IN numbers | toFloat(n)] AS float_numbers
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | float_numbers    |
      | [1.0, 2.0, null] |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [5] `toFloat()` on node property
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:Movie {rating: 4})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (m:Movie { rating: 4 })
      WITH *
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN toFloat(n.rating) AS float
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | float |
      | 4.0   |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  @NegativeTest
  Scenario Outline: [6] `toFloat()` failing on invalid arguments
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()-[:T]->()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH p = (n)-[r:T]->()
      RETURN [x IN [1.0, <invalid>] | toFloat(x) ] AS list
      """
    Then a TypeError should be raised at runtime: InvalidArgumentValue

    Examples:
      | invalid |
      | true    |
      | []      |
      | {}      |
      | n       |
      | r       |
      | p       |
