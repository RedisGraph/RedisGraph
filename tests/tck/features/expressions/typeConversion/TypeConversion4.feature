Feature: TypeConversion4 - To String

  Scenario: [1] `toString()` handling integer literal
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN toString(42) AS bool
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | bool   |
      | '42' |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [2] `toString()` handling boolean literal
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN toString(true) AS bool
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | bool   |
      | 'true' |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [3] `toString()` handling inlined boolean
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN toString(1 < 0) AS bool
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | bool    |
      | 'false' |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [4] `toString()` handling boolean properties
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:Movie {watched: true})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (m:Movie)
      RETURN toString(m.watched)

    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | toString(m.watched) |
      | 'true'              |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [5] `toString()` should work on Any type
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN [x IN [1, 2.3, true, 'apa'] | toString(x) ] AS list
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | list                        |
      | ['1', '2.3', 'true', 'apa'] |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [6] `toString()` on a list of integers
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3] AS numbers
      RETURN [n IN numbers | toString(n)] AS string_numbers
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | string_numbers  |
      | ['1', '2', '3'] |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [7] `toString()` on node property
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:Movie {rating: 4})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (m:Movie { rating: 4 })
      WITH *
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN toString(n.rating)
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | toString(n.rating) |
      | '4'                |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [8] `toString()` should accept potentially correct types 1
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      UNWIND ['male', 'female', null] AS gen
      RETURN coalesce(toString(gen), 'x') AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:

      | 'male'   |
      | 'female' |
      | 'x'      |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [9] `toString()` should accept potentially correct types 2
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      UNWIND ['male', 'female', null] AS gen
      RETURN toString(coalesce(gen, 'x')) AS result

  Scenario Outline: [10] `toString()` failing on invalid arguments
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()-[:T]->()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH p = (n)-[r:T]->()
      RETURN [x IN [1, '', <invalid>] | toString(x) ] AS list
      """
    Then a TypeError should be raised at runtime: InvalidArgumentValue

    Examples:
      | invalid |
      | []      |
      | {}      |
      | n       |
      | r       |
      | p       |
