Feature: Boolean4 - NOT logical operations

  Scenario: [1] NOT and false
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({name: 'a'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      WHERE NOT(n.name = 'apa' AND false)
      RETURN n
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | n             |
      | ({name: 'a'}) |
    And no side effects

  @NegativeTest
  Scenario Outline: [2] Fail when using NOT on a non-boolean literal
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN NOT <literal>
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: InvalidArgumentType

    Examples:
      | literal          |
      | 0                |
      | 1                |
