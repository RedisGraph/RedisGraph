  Scenario Outline: [1] Should compare dates
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH date(<map>) AS x, date(<map2>) AS d
      RETURN x > d, x < d, x >= d, x <= d, x = d
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | x > d | x < d | x >= d | x <= d | x = d |
      | <gt>  | <lt>  | <ge>   | <le>   | <e>   |
    And no side effects
