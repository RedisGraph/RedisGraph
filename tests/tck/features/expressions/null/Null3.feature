Feature: Null3 - Null evaluation
# the scenarios of this feature should be redistributed to the features of respective operations

  Scenario: [1] The inverse of a null is a null
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN NOT null AS value
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | value |
      | null  |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] It is unknown - i.e. null - if a null is equal to a null
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN null = null AS value
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | value |
      | null  |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [3] It is unknown - i.e. null - if a null is not equal to a null
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN null <> null AS value
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | value |
      | null  |
    And no side effects

  Scenario Outline: [4] Using null in IN
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | elt  | <elt>  |
      | coll | <coll> |
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN $elt IN $coll AS result
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | result   |
      | <result> |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | elt  | coll            | result |
      | null | null            | null   |
      | null | [1, 2, 3]       | null   |
      | null | [1, 2, 3, null] | null   |
      | null | []              | false  |
      | 1    | [1, 2, 3, null] | true   |
      | 1    | [null, 1]       | true   |
      | 5    | [1, 2, 3, null] | null   |
