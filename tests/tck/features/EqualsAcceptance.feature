  Scenario: Number-typed integer comparison
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({id: 0})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH collect([0, 0.0]) AS numbers
      UNWIND numbers AS arr
      WITH arr[0] AS expected
      MATCH (n) WHERE toInteger(n.id) = expected
      RETURN n
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | n         |
      | ({id: 0}) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Number-typed float comparison
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({id: 0})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH collect([0.5, 0]) AS numbers

  Scenario: Comparing nodes to nodes
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)

  Scenario: Comparing relationships to relationships
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()-[:T]->()
      """
    When executing query:
      """

  Scenario Outline: Comparing lists to lists
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """

      | [1, 2]        | [1]           | false  |

      | [[1]]         | [[1], [null]] | false  |
      | [[1], [2]]    | [[1], [null]] | null   |
