Feature: RemoveAcceptance

  Scenario: Should ignore nulls
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({num: 42})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r]->()
      REMOVE r.num
      RETURN n

    Then the result should be:
      | n           |
      | ({num: 42}) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Remove a single label
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:L {num: 42})

    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)

  Scenario: Remove multiple labels
    Given an empty graph

  Scenario: Remove a single node property

  Scenario: Remove a single relationship property
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (a), (b), (a)-[:X {num: 42}]->(b)

      | props |
      | 1     |
    And the side effects should be:
      | -properties | 2 |

  Scenario: Remove a missing property should be a valid operation
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (), (), ()
      """
    When executing query:
