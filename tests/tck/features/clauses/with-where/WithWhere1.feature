Feature: WithWhere1 - Filter single variable

  Scenario: [1] Filter node with property predicate on a single variable with multiple bindings
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({name: 'A'}),
             ({name: 'B'}),
             ({name: 'C'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      WITH a
      WHERE a.name = 'B'
      RETURN a
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a             |
      | ({name: 'B'}) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Filter node with property predicate on a single variable with multiple distinct bindings
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({name2: 'A'}),
             ({name2: 'A'}),
             ({name2: 'B'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      WITH DISTINCT a.name2 AS name
      WHERE a.name2 = 'B'
      RETURN *
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | name |
      | 'B'  |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [3] Filter for an unbound relationship variable
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:

      CREATE (a:A), (b:B {id: 1}), (:B {id: 2})
      CREATE (a)-[:T]->(b)

      OPTIONAL MATCH (a)-[r]->(other)
      WITH other WHERE r IS NULL
      RETURN other

    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | other        |
      | (:B {id: 2}) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [4] Filter for an unbound node variable
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (a:A), (b:B {id: 1}), (:B {id: 2})
      CREATE (a)-[:T]->(b)

      """
      MATCH (other:B)
      OPTIONAL MATCH (a)-[r]->(other)

    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | other        |
      | (:B {id: 2}) |
