Feature: Remove1 - Remove a Property

  @skip
  Scenario: [1] Remove a single node property
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:L {num: 42})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      REMOVE n.num
      RETURN exists(n.num) AS still_there
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | still_there |
      | false       |
    And the side effects should be:
      | -properties | 1 |

  @skip
  Scenario: [2] Remove multiple node properties
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:L {num: 42, name: 'a', name2: 'B'})
