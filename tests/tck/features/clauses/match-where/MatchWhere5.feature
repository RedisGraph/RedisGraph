Feature: MatchWhere5 - Filter on predicate resulting in null

  Scenario: [1] Filter out on null
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (root:Root {name: 'x'}),
             (child1:TextNode {var: 'text'}),
             (child2:IntNode {var: 0})
      CREATE (root)-[:T]->(child1),
             (root)-[:T]->(child2)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (:Root {name: 'x'})-->(i:TextNode)
      WHERE i.var > 'te'
      RETURN i
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | i                         |
      | (:TextNode {var: 'text'}) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Filter out on null if the AND'd predicate evaluates to false
