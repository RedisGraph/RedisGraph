Feature: MatchWhere4 - Non-Equi-Joins on variables

  Scenario: [1] Join nodes on inequality
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:A), (:B)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a), (b)
      WHERE a <> b
      RETURN a, b
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a    | b    |
      | (:A) | (:B) |
      | (:B) | (:A) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Join with disjunctive multi-part predicates including patterns
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (a:TheLabel {id: 0}), (b:TheLabel {id: 1}), (c:TheLabel {id: 2})
      CREATE (a)-[:T]->(b),
             (b)-[:T]->(c)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a), (b)
      WHERE a.id = 0
        AND (a)-[:T]->(b:TheLabel)
        OR (a)-[:T*]->(b:MissingLabel)
      RETURN DISTINCT b
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | b                   |
      | (:TheLabel {id: 1}) |
    And no side effects
