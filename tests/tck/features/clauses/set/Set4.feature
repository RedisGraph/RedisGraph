Feature: Set4 - Set all properties with a map

  @skip
  Scenario: [1] Set multiple properties with a property map
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:X)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n:X)
      SET n = {name: 'A', name2: 'B', num: 5}
      RETURN n
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | n                                    |
      | (:X {name: 'A', name2: 'B', num: 5}) |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +properties | 3 |

  @skip
  Scenario: [2] Non-existent values in a property map are removed with SET
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:X {name: 'A', name2: 'B'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n:X {name: 'A'})

      | n                          |
      | (:X {name: 'B', baz: 'C'}) |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +properties | 2 |
      | -properties | 2 |

  @skip
  Scenario: [3] Null values in a property map are removed with SET
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:X {name: 'A', name2: 'B'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n:X {name: 'A'})
      SET n = {name: 'B', name2: null, baz: 'C'}
      RETURN n

      | n                          |
      | (:X {name: 'B', baz: 'C'}) |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +properties | 2 |
      | -properties | 2 |

  @skip
  Scenario: [4] All properties are removed if node is set to empty property map
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:X {name: 'A', name2: 'B'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n:X {name: 'A'})
      SET n = { }
      RETURN n

    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | n    |
      | (:X) |
    And the side effects should be:
      | -properties | 2 |

  @skip
  Scenario: [5] Ignore null when setting properties using an overriding map
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      OPTIONAL MATCH (a:DoesNotExist)
      SET a = {num: 42}
      RETURN a
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a    |
      | null |
    And no side effects
