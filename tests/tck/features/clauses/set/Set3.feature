Feature: Set3 - Set a Label

  @skip
  Scenario: [1] Add a single label to a node with no label
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      SET n:Foo
      RETURN n
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | n      |
      | (:Foo) |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +labels | 1 |

  @skip
  Scenario: [2] Adding multiple labels to a node with no label
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      SET n:Foo:Bar

  Scenario: [3] Add a single label to a node with an existing label
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """

    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n:A)

    When executing query:
      """

      | (:A:Foo:Bar) |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +labels | 2 |

  @skip
  Scenario: [5] Ignore whitespace before colon 1
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()

    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      SET n :Foo

    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | labels(n) |
      | ['Foo']   |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +labels | 1 |

  @skip
  Scenario: [6] Ignore whitespace before colon 2
    Given an empty graph
