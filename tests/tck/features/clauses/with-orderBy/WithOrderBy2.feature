Feature: WithOrderBy2 - Order by a single expression

  Scenario: [1] ORDER BY on an aggregating key
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({name: 'A'}),
             ({name: 'A'}),
             ({name: 'B'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      WITH a.name AS bars, count(*) AS relCount
      ORDER BY a.name
      RETURN *
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | bars | relCount |
      | 'A'  | 2        |
      | 'B'  | 1        |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] ORDER BY a DISTINCT column
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({name: 'A'}),
             ({name: 'A'}),
             ({name: 'B'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      WITH DISTINCT a.name AS bars
      ORDER BY a.name
      RETURN *
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | bars |
      | 'A'  |
      | 'B'  |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [3] Fail on aggregation in ORDER BY after WITH
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      WITH n.num1 AS foo
        ORDER BY max(n.num2)
      RETURN foo AS foo
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: InvalidAggregation
