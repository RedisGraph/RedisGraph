Feature: Match8 - Match clause interoperation with other clauses

  Scenario: [1] Pattern independented of bound variables results in cross product
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:A), (:B)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      WITH a
      MATCH (b)
      RETURN a, b

    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a    | b    |
      | (:A) | (:A) |
      | (:A) | (:B) |
      | (:B) | (:A) |
      | (:B) | (:B) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Counting rows after MATCH, MERGE, OPTIONAL MATCH
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
