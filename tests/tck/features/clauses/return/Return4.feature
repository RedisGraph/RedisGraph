Feature: Return4 - Column renaming

  Scenario: [1] Honour the column name for RETURN items
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({name: 'Someone'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      WITH a.name AS a
      RETURN a
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a         |
      | 'Someone' |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Support column renaming
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:Singleton)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      RETURN a AS ColumnName
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | ColumnName   |
      | (:Singleton) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [3] Aliasing expressions
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({id: 42})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      RETURN a.id AS a, a.id
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a  | a.id |
      | 42 | 42   |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [4] Keeping used expression 1
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN cOuNt( * )
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | cOuNt( * ) |
      | 1          |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [5] Keeping used expression 2
    Given an empty graph
