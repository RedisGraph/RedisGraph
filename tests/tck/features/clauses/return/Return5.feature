Feature: Return5 - Implicit grouping with distinct

  Scenario: [1] DISTINCT inside aggregation should work with lists in maps
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({list: ['A', 'B']}), ({list: ['A', 'B']})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN count(DISTINCT {name: n.list}) AS count
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | count |
      | 1     |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] DISTINCT on nullable values
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({name: 'Florescu'}), (), ()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN DISTINCT n.name
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | n.name     |
      | 'Florescu' |
      | null       |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [3] DISTINCT inside aggregation should work with nested lists in maps
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({list: ['A', 'B']}), ({list: ['A', 'B']})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN count(DISTINCT {name: [[n.list, n.list], [n.list, n.list]]}) AS count
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | count |
      | 1     |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [4] DISTINCT inside aggregation should work with nested lists of maps in maps
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({list: ['A', 'B']}), ({list: ['A', 'B']})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN count(DISTINCT {name: [{name2: n.list}, {baz: {apa: n.list}}]}) AS count
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | count |
      | 1     |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [5] Aggregate on list values
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({color: ['red']})
      CREATE ({color: ['blue']})
      CREATE ({color: ['red']})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      RETURN DISTINCT a.color, count(*)
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a.color  | count(*) |
      | ['red']  | 2        |
      | ['blue'] | 1        |
    And no side effects
