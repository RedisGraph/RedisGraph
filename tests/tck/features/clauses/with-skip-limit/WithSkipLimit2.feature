Feature: WithSkipLimit2 - Limit

  Scenario: [1] ORDER BY and LIMIT can be used
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (a:A), (), (), (),
             (a)-[:REL]->()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a:A)
      WITH a
      ORDER BY a.name
      LIMIT 1
      MATCH (a)-->(b)
      RETURN a
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a    |
      | (:A) |
    And no side effects
