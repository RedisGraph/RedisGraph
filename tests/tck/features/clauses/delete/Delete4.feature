  Scenario: [1] Undirected expand followed by delete and count
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()-[:R]->()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)-[r]-(b)
      DELETE r, a, b
      RETURN count(*) AS c

    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | c |
      | 2 |
    And the side effects should be:
      | -nodes         | 2 |
      | -relationships | 1 |
