Feature: Delete1 - Deleting nodes

  Scenario: [1] Delete nodes
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      DELETE n
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | -nodes | 1 |

  Scenario: [2] Detach delete node
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      DETACH DELETE n
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | -nodes | 1 |

  @skip
  Scenario: [3] Detach deleting connected nodes and relationships
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (x:X)
      CREATE (x)-[:R]->()
      CREATE (x)-[:R]->()
      CREATE (x)-[:R]->()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n:X)
      DETACH DELETE n
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | -nodes         | 1 |
      | -relationships | 3 |
      | -labels        | 1 |

  Scenario: [4] Delete on null node
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      OPTIONAL MATCH (n)
      DELETE n
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [5] Ignore null when deleting node
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      OPTIONAL MATCH (a:DoesNotExist)
      DELETE a
      RETURN a
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a    |
      | null |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [6] Detach delete on null node
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      OPTIONAL MATCH (n)
      DETACH DELETE n
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [7] Failing when deleting connected nodes
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (x:X)
      CREATE (x)-[:R]->()
      CREATE (x)-[:R]->()
      CREATE (x)-[:R]->()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n:X)
      DELETE n
      """
    Then a ConstraintVerificationFailed should be raised at runtime: DeleteConnectedNode

  @NegativeTest
  @skip
  Scenario: [8] Failing when deleting a label
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      DELETE n:Person
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: InvalidDelete
