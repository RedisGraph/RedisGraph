Feature: Delete2 - Deleting relationships

  @skip
  Scenario: [1] Delete relationships
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      UNWIND range(0, 2) AS i
      CREATE ()-[:R]->()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH ()-[r]-()
      DELETE r
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | -relationships | 3 |

  Scenario: [2] Delete optionally matched relationship
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r]-()
      DELETE n, r
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | -nodes | 1 |

  @skip
  Scenario: [3] Delete relationship with bidirectional matching
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()-[:T {id: 42}]->()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH p = ()-[r:T]-()
      WHERE r.id = 42
      DELETE r
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | -relationships | 1 |
      | -properties    | 1 |


  Scenario: [4] Ignore null when deleting relationship
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      OPTIONAL MATCH ()-[r:DoesNotExist]-()
      DELETE r
      RETURN r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r    |
      | null |
    And no side effects

  @NegativeTest
  @skip
  Scenario: [5] Failing when deleting a relationship type
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()-[:T {id: 42}]->()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH ()-[r:T]-()
      DELETE r:T
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: InvalidDelete
