Feature: ReturnOrderBy4 - Order by in combination with projection

  @skip
  Scenario: [1] ORDER BY of a column introduced in RETURN should return salient results in ascending order
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [0, 1] AS prows, [[2], [3, 4]] AS qrows
      UNWIND prows AS p
      UNWIND qrows[p] AS q
      WITH p, count(q) AS rng
      RETURN p
      ORDER BY rng
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | p |
      | 0 |
      | 1 |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [2] Handle projections with ORDER BY
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (c1:Crew {name: 'Neo', rank: 1}),
        (c2:Crew {name: 'Neo', rank: 2}),
        (c3:Crew {name: 'Neo', rank: 3}),
        (c4:Crew {name: 'Neo', rank: 4}),
        (c5:Crew {name: 'Neo', rank: 5})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (c:Crew {name: 'Neo'})
      WITH c, 0 AS relevance
      RETURN c.rank AS rank
      ORDER BY relevance, c.rank
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | rank |
      | 1    |
      | 2    |
      | 3    |
      | 4    |
      | 5    |
    And no side effects
