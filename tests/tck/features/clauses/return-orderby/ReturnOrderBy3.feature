  Scenario: [1] Sort on aggregate function and normal property
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({division: 'Sweden'})
      CREATE ({division: 'Germany'})
      CREATE ({division: 'England'})
      CREATE ({division: 'Sweden'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN n.division, count(*)
      ORDER BY count(*) DESC, n.division ASC
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | n.division | count(*) |
      | 'Sweden'   | 2        |
      | 'England'  | 1        |
      | 'Germany'  | 1        |
    And no side effects
