Feature: Call2 - Procedure arguments

  @skip
  Scenario: [1] In-query call to procedure with explicit arguments
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure test.my.proc(name :: STRING?, id :: INTEGER?) :: (city :: STRING?, country_code :: INTEGER?):
      | name     | id | city      | country_code |
      | 'Andres' | 1  | 'Malmö'   | 46           |
      | 'Tobias' | 1  | 'Malmö'   | 46           |
      | 'Mats'   | 1  | 'Malmö'   | 46           |
      | 'Stefan' | 1  | 'Berlin'  | 49           |
      | 'Stefan' | 2  | 'München' | 49           |
      | 'Petra'  | 1  | 'London'  | 44           |
    When executing query:
      """
      CALL test.my.proc('Stefan', 1) YIELD city, country_code
      RETURN city, country_code
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | city     | country_code |
      | 'Berlin' | 49           |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Standalone call to procedure with explicit arguments
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure test.my.proc(name :: STRING?, id :: INTEGER?) :: (city :: STRING?, country_code :: INTEGER?):
