Feature: Call5 - Results projection

  @skip
  Scenario: [1] Explicit procedure result projection
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure test.my.proc(in :: INTEGER?) :: (out :: STRING?):
      | in   | out   |
      | null | 'nix' |
    When executing query:
      """
      CALL test.my.proc(null) YIELD out
      RETURN out
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | out   |
      | 'nix' |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [2] Explicit procedure result projection with RETURN *
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure test.my.proc(in :: INTEGER?) :: (out :: STRING?):
      | in   | out   |
      | null | 'nix' |
    When executing query:
      """
      CALL test.my.proc(null) YIELD out
      RETURN *
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | out   |
      | 'nix' |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario Outline: [3] The order of yield items is irrelevant
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure test.my.proc(in :: INTEGER?) :: (a :: INTEGER?, b :: INTEGER?) :
      | in   | a | b |
      | null | 1 | 2 |
    When executing query:
      """
      CALL test.my.proc(null) YIELD <yield>
      RETURN a, b
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | a | b |
      | 1 | 2 |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | yield |
      | a, b  |
      | b, a  |

  @skip
  Scenario Outline: [4] Rename outputs to unbound variable names
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure test.my.proc(in :: INTEGER?) :: (a :: INTEGER?, b :: INTEGER?) :
      | in   | a | b |
      | null | 1 | 2 |
    When executing query:
      """
      CALL test.my.proc(null) YIELD <rename>
      RETURN <a>, <b>
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | <a> | <b> |
      | 1   | 2   |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | rename         | a | b |
      | a AS c, b AS d | c | d |
      | a AS b, b AS d | b | d |
      | a AS c, b AS a | c | a |
      | a AS b, b AS a | b | a |
      | a AS c, b AS b | c | b |
      | a AS c, b      | c | b |
      | a AS a, b AS d | a | d |
      | a, b AS d      | a | d |
      | a AS a, b AS b | a | b |
      | a AS a, b      | a | b |
      | a, b AS b      | a | b |

  Scenario: [5] Fail on renaming to an already bound variable name
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure test.my.proc(in :: INTEGER?) :: (a :: INTEGER?, b :: INTEGER?) :
      | in   | a | b |
      | null | 1 | 2 |
    When executing query:
      """
      CALL test.my.proc(null) YIELD a, b AS a
      RETURN a
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: VariableAlreadyBound

  @skip
  Scenario: [6] Fail on renaming all outputs to the same variable name
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure test.my.proc(in :: INTEGER?) :: (a :: INTEGER?, b :: INTEGER?) :
      | in   | a | b |
      | null | 1 | 2 |
    When executing query:
      """
      CALL test.my.proc(null) YIELD a AS c, b AS c
      RETURN c
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: VariableAlreadyBound

  Scenario: [7] Fail on in-query call to procedure with YIELD *
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure test.my.proc(name :: STRING?, id :: INTEGER?) :: (city :: STRING?, country_code :: INTEGER?):
      | name     | id | city      | country_code |

      | 'Petra'  | 1  | 'London'  | 44           |
    When executing query:
      """
      CALL test.my.proc('Stefan', 1) YIELD *
      RETURN city, country_code
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: UnexpectedSyntax

  @skip
  Scenario: [8] Allow standalone call to procedure with YIELD *
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure test.my.proc(name :: STRING?, id :: INTEGER?) :: (city :: STRING?, country_code :: INTEGER?):
      | name     | id | city      | country_code |
      | 'Andres' | 1  | 'Malmö'   | 46           |

      | 'Stefan' | 1  | 'Berlin'  | 49           |
      | 'Stefan' | 2  | 'München' | 49           |
      | 'Petra'  | 1  | 'London'  | 44           |
    When executing query:
      """
      CALL test.my.proc('Stefan', 1) YIELD *
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | city     | country_code |
      | 'Berlin' | 49           |
