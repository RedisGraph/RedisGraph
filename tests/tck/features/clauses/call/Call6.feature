Feature: Call6 - Call clause interoperation with other clauses

  Scenario: [1] Calling the same STRING procedure twice using the same outputs in each call
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure test.labels() :: (label :: STRING?):
      | label |
      | 'A'   |
      | 'B'   |
      | 'C'   |
    When executing query:
      """
      CALL test.labels() YIELD label
      WITH count(*) AS c
      CALL test.labels() YIELD label
      RETURN *
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | c | label |
      | 3 | 'A'   |
      | 3 | 'B'   |
      | 3 | 'C'   |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [2] Project procedure results between query scopes with WITH clause
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure test.my.proc(in :: INTEGER?) :: (out :: STRING?):
      | in   | out   |
      | null | 'nix' |
    When executing query:
      """
      CALL test.my.proc(null) YIELD out
      WITH out RETURN out
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | out   |
      | 'nix' |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [3] Project procedure results between query scopes with WITH clause and rename the projection
    Given an empty graph
    And there exists a procedure test.my.proc(in :: INTEGER?) :: (out :: STRING?):
      | in   | out   |
      | null | 'nix' |
    When executing query:
      """
      CALL test.my.proc(null) YIELD out
      WITH out AS a RETURN a
      """
    Then the result should be, in order:
      | a     |
      | 'nix' |
    And no side effects
