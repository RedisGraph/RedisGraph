Feature: Create1 - Creating nodes

  Scenario: [1] Create a single node
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE ()
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes | 1 |

  Scenario: [2] Create two nodes
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (), ()
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes | 2 |

  Scenario: [3] Create a single node with a label
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (:Label)
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes  | 1 |
      | +labels | 1 |

  Scenario: [4] Create a single node with multiple labels
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (:A:B:C:D)
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes  | 1 |
      | +labels | 4 |

  Scenario: [5] Create a single node with a property
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE ({created: true})
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes      | 1 |
      | +properties | 1 |

  Scenario: [6] Create a single node with a property and return it
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (n {name: 'foo'})
      RETURN n.name AS p

    Then the result should be, in any order:

      | 'foo' |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes      | 1 |
      | +properties | 1 |

  Scenario: [7] Create a single node with two properties
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """

    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes      | 1 |
      | +properties | 2 |

  Scenario: [8] Create a single node with two properties and return them
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (n {id: 12, name: 'foo'})
      RETURN n.id AS id, n.name AS p
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | id | p     |
      | 12 | 'foo' |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes      | 1 |
      | +properties | 2 |

  Scenario: [9] Create a single node with null properties should not return those properties
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (n {id: 12, name: null})
      RETURN n.id AS id, n.name AS p
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | id | p    |
      | 12 | null |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes      | 1 |
      | +properties | 1 |

  Scenario: [10] CREATE does not lose precision on large integers
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
