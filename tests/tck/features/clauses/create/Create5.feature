Feature: Create5 - Multiple hops create patterns

  Scenario: [1] Create a pattern with multiple hops
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (:A)-[:R]->(:B)-[:R]->(:C)
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes         | 3 |
      | +relationships | 2 |
      | +labels        | 3 |
    When executing control query:
      """
      MATCH (a:A)-[:R]->(b:B)-[:R]->(c:C)
      RETURN a, b, c
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a    | b    | c    |
      | (:A) | (:B) | (:C) |

  Scenario: [2] Create a pattern with multiple hops in the reverse direction
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (:A)<-[:R]-(:B)<-[:R]-(:C)
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes         | 3 |
      | +relationships | 2 |
      | +labels        | 3 |
    When executing control query:
      """
      MATCH (a)<-[:R]-(b)<-[:R]-(c)
      RETURN a, b, c
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a    | b    | c    |
      | (:A) | (:B) | (:C) |

  Scenario: [3] Create a pattern with multiple hops in varying directions
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (:A)-[:R]->(:B)<-[:R]-(:C)
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes         | 3 |
      | +relationships | 2 |
      | +labels        | 3 |
    When executing control query:
      """
      MATCH (a:A)-[r1:R]->(b:B)<-[r2:R]-(c:C)
      RETURN a, b, c
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a    | b    | c    |
      | (:A) | (:B) | (:C) |

  Scenario: [4] Create a pattern with multiple hops with multiple types and varying directions
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE ()-[:R1]->()<-[:R2]-()-[:R3]->()
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes         | 4 |
      | +relationships | 3 |
    When executing control query:
      """
      MATCH ()-[r1:R1]->()<-[r2:R2]-()-[r3:R3]->()
      RETURN r1, r2, r3
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r1    | r2    | r3    |
      | [:R1] | [:R2] | [:R3] |

  Scenario: [5] Create a pattern with multiple hops and varying directions
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (:A)<-[:R1]-(:B)-[:R2]->(:C)
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes         | 3 |
      | +relationships | 2 |

    When executing control query:
      """
      MATCH (a:A)<-[r1:R1]-(b:B)-[r2:R2]->(c:C)
      RETURN *
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a    | b    | c    | r1    | r2    |
      | (:A) | (:B) | (:C) | [:R1] | [:R2] |
