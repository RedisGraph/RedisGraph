  Scenario: [1] Forwarding a property to express a join
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (a:End {num: 42, id: 0}),
             (:End {num: 3}),
             (:Begin {num: a.id})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a:Begin)
      WITH a.num AS property
      MATCH (b)
      WHERE b.id = property
      RETURN b
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | b                       |
      | (:End {num: 42, id: 0}) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Forwarding a nested map literal
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH {name: {name2: 'baz'}} AS nestedMap
      RETURN nestedMap.name.name2
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | nestedMap.name.name2 |
      | 'baz'                |
    And no side effects
