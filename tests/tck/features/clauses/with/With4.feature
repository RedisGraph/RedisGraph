Feature: With4 - Variable aliasing
  # correctly aliasing variables

  Scenario: [1] Aliasing relationship variable
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()-[:T1]->(),
             ()-[:T2]->()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH ()-[r1]->()
      WITH r1 AS r2
      RETURN r2 AS rel
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | rel   |
      | [:T1] |
      | [:T2] |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Aliasing expression to new variable name
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:Begin {num: 42}),
             (:End {num: 42}),
             (:End {num: 3})

    When executing query:

      | b                |
      | (:End {num: 42}) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [3] Aliasing expression to exsiting variable name
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({num: 1, name: 'King Kong'}),
        ({num: 2, name: 'Ann Darrow'})

    When executing query:

      MATCH (n)

    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | n            |
      | 'Ann Darrow' |
      | 'King Kong'  |
    And no side effects

  @NegativeTest
  @skip
  Scenario: [4] Fail when forwarding multiple aliases with the same name
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH 1 AS a, 2 AS a
      RETURN a
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: ColumnNameConflict

  @NegativeTest
  Scenario: [5] Fail when not aliasing expressions in WITH
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      WITH a, count(*)
      RETURN a
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: NoExpressionAlias

  Scenario: [6] Reusing variable names in WITH
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (a:Person), (b:Person), (m:Message {id: 10})

    Then the result should be, in order:
      | likeTime |

  Scenario: [7] Multiple aliasing and backreferencing
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (m {id: 0})
      WITH {first: m.id} AS m
      WITH {second: m.first} AS m
      RETURN m.second

    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | m.second |
      | 0        |
    And the side effects should be:
