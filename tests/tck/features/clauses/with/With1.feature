  Scenario: [1] Forwarind a node variable 1
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:A)-[:REL]->(:B)
      """
    When executing query:

      MATCH (a:A)
      WITH a
      MATCH (a)-->(b)
      RETURN *

    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a    | b    |
      | (:A) | (:B) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] Forwarind a node variable 2
