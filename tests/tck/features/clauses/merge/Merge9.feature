Feature: Merge9 - Merge clause interoperation with other clauses

  Scenario: [1] UNWIND with one MERGE
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      UNWIND [1, 2, 3, 4] AS int
      MERGE (n {id: int})
      RETURN count(*)
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | count(*) |
      | 4        |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes      | 4 |
      | +properties | 4 |

  @skip
  Scenario: [2] UNWIND with multiple MERGE
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      UNWIND ['Keanu Reeves', 'Hugo Weaving', 'Carrie-Anne Moss', 'Laurence Fishburne'] AS actor
      MERGE (m:Movie {name: 'The Matrix'})
      MERGE (p:Person {name: actor})
      MERGE (p)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:

      | +relationships | 4 |
      | +labels        | 2 |
      | +properties    | 5 |

  Scenario: [3] Mixing MERGE with CREATE
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (a:A), (b:B)
      MERGE (a)-[:KNOWS]->(b)
      CREATE (b)-[:KNOWS]->(c:C)

    Then the result should be, in any order:

      | +nodes         | 3 |
      | +relationships | 2 |
      | +labels        | 3 |

  Scenario: [4] MERGE after WITH with predicate and WITH with aggregation
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:A {num: 42})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      UNWIND [42] AS props
      WITH props WHERE props > 32
      WITH DISTINCT props AS p
      MERGE (a:A {num: p})
      RETURN a.num AS prop
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | prop |
      | 42   |
    And no side effects
