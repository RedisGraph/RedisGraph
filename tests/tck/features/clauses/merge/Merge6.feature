Feature: Merge6 - Merge relationships - on create

  Scenario: [1] Using ON CREATE on a node
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:A), (:B)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a:A), (b:B)
      MERGE (a)-[:KNOWS]->(b)
        ON CREATE SET b.created = 1
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +relationships | 1 |
      | +properties    | 1 |

  Scenario: [2] Using ON CREATE on a relationship
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:

    Then the result should be, in any order:
