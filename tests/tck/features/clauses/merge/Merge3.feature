Feature: Merge3 - Merge node - on match

  @skip
  Scenario: [1] Merge should be able to set labels on match
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ()
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MERGE (a)
        ON MATCH SET a:L
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +labels | 1 |

  @skip
  Scenario: [2] Merge node with label add label on match when it exists
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:TheLabel)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MERGE (a:TheLabel)
        ON MATCH SET a:Foo
      RETURN labels(a)
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | labels(a)           |
      | ['TheLabel', 'Foo'] |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +labels | 1 |

  Scenario: [3] Merge node and set property on match
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:TheLabel)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MERGE (a:TheLabel)
        ON MATCH SET a.num = 42
      RETURN a.num
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a.num |
      | 42    |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +properties | 1 |

  @skip
  Scenario: [4] Merge should be able to use properties of bound node in ON MATCH
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:Person {bornIn: 'New York'}),
        (:Person {bornIn: 'Ohio'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (person:Person)
      MERGE (city:City)
        ON MATCH SET city.name = person.bornIn
      RETURN person.bornIn
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | person.bornIn |
      | 'New York'    |
      | 'Ohio'        |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes      | 1 |
      | +labels     | 1 |
      | +properties | 1 |

  @NegativeTest
  Scenario: [5] Fail when using undefined variable in ON MATCH
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      MERGE (n)
        ON MATCH SET x.num = 1
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: UndefinedVariable
