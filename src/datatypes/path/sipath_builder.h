/* The API allows to build a SIPath. The current implementation allows to build the path according to
 * named path AST path pattern, when iterated in order, or in other words, when the given query is read
 * from left to right.
 * "MATCH p=(a)-[*]->(b)-[]->(c) RETURN p" will yield the following building sequence
 * 1. Create new empty path.
 * 2. Append node (a).
 * 3. Append path. All variable length traversal results, when part of path building sequence, are path themsevles.
 *    Note that the intermidiate path order might be reversed, during path building, to comply to the query.
 *    Since intermidate path are not projected, they can be mutable.
 * 4. Append node (b).
 * 5. Append edge. Note: If the edge value source and destination are reversed to the query pattern,
 *    a copy of the edge will be added to the path, with the source and destination swapped. This is due to
 *    SIEdge value is immutable, since it might be projected from the record.
 * 6. Append node (c). */
