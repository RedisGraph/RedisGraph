This file contains a data structure of a circular buffer without a read
guarantee, meaning it is possible to overwrite the elements that haven't been
read yet. This is useful when we want to only be able to see the "last top-N"
elements stored within the container, and we aren't interested in the ones that
were added earlier than these "last top-N". Hence, this structure's name
contains the "NRG" suffix - "No Read Guarantee".

A few features of the data structure:

1. It is possible to specify a custom deleter specified if it is required for
certain types.
2. It can dynamically grow in size and shrink.
3. It allows two versions of accessing the stored elements - one that adjusts
the read pointer and one that doesn't; both are useful.
4. It is possible to traverse the whole collection without the overhead and
making copies, by providing a custom callback function which will be called for
each of the stored item, by providing a pointer to it for further
re-interpretation by the caller. During such a traversal, the custom callback
function may force the ongoing traversal to stop by means of the return value.
