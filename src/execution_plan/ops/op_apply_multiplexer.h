/* ApplyMultiplexer operation tests for condition satisfaction over multiple execution plan
 * branches. The branches can be a simple filter operation, SemiApply operations,
 * or ApplyMultiplexer operations. The logic applied by the operation is defined by the
 * boolean operators OR and AND.
 * ORApplyMultiplexer: Starts by pulling on the bounded branch,
 * for each record received it tries to get a record from the filter branch, if exists. If
 * the filter is not exists, or did not return any record, the operation will check each of its branches
 * until a record is found. If no data is produced from any branch,it will try to fetch a new data point
 * from the bounded branch, otherwise the bounded branch record is passed onward.
 * ANDApplyMultiplexer: Starts by pulling on the bounded branch,
 * for each record received it tries to get a record from the filter branch, if exists. If
 * the filter is not exists, or the filter returned a record, the ANDApplyMultiplexer should make sure that
 * each branch was able to produce a record. If one branch did not produced any data, the operation will try to fetch
 * a new data point from the bounded branch, otherwise the bounded branch
 * record is passed onward.
