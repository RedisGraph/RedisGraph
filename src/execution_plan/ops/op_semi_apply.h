 * Normal Semi Apply: Starts by pulling on the main execution plan branch,
 * for each record received it tries to get a record from the match branch
 * if no data is produced it will try to fetch a new data point from the main execution plan branch,
 * otherwise the main execution plan branch record is passed onward.
 * Anti Semi Apply: Starts by pulling on the main execution plan branch,
 * for each record received it tries to get a record from the match branch
 * if no data is produced the main execution plan branch record is passed onward
 * otherwise it will try to fetch a new data point from the main execution plan branch. */
